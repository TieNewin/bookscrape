Requirements for Price Monitoring System

This document contains the requirements and instructions for developing a beta
version of a price monitoring system for Books Online.

Notes:
	● While working, store your code in a GitHub repository and make frequent
	commits.
	● Remember to commit a requirements.txt file, but don’t store your virtual
	environment in your repository.
	● You also shouldn’t commit your CSV files.
	● Write a README.md file and add it to the repository, giving instructions on
	how to run your code successfully and output some data.

Phase 1

	Pick any single product page (i.e., a single book) on Books to Scrape, and write a
	Python script that visits this page and extracts the following information:
		● product_page_url
		● universal_ product_code (upc)
		● book_title
		● price_including_tax
		● price_excluding_tax
		● quantity_available
		● product_description
		● category
		● review_rating
		● image_url
	Write the data to a CSV file using the above fields as column headings.

Phase 2

	Now that you have obtained the information for one book, you should get all of
	the necessary information for one category.
	Pick any book category on Books to Scrape, and write a Python script that visits
	this category page and extracts the product page URL for each book in the
	category.
	Then combine this script with the work you have completed in Phase 1 to extract
	the product data for each book in your category and write the data to a single
	CSV file.

	Note: some category pages have more than 20 books listed, spread across
	different pages. This is referred to as pagination. Your application should be able
	to handle this scenario automatically.

Phase 3

	Write a script that visits Books to Scrape, extracts all the book categories available,
	and then extracts product information for all books across all categories. You
	should write the data for each book category in a separate CSV file.

Phase 4

	Finally, extend your existing work to download and save the image file for each
	product page you visit.
